### Issue

[Issue 263](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/263)


### Description

Wait a tick, here's a question:  Can PHP be running using node?  Sure enough there is a lib for that => 
[node-php](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-php).  Hmmm, what does that do?  Time for another node fiddle. Note,
this fiddle doesn't actually work.  I gave up on using the lib after about 2 hours of research.  If its that
complicated, there is no point.  However, I am leaving the fiddle in place as record of my attempt to use
the library.
