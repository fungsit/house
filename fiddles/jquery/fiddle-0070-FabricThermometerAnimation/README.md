### Title

Fabric.js Thermometer with Configurable Image Meniscus


### Creation Date

### Location

Chicago, IL


### Issue

[Issue 258](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/issues/258)


### Description

[Jquery Fiddle #68](https://github.com/bradyhouse/house/tree/master/fiddles/jquery/fiddle-0068-FabricThermometerImgMeniscus) uses a crude approach to animation.  Essentially, it just redraws the canvas in loop.  In each pass it increments the height (position) of the meniscus. This is fine except that it seems to introduce a flicker effect. I need to figure out how to fix this--i.e. __what's the right way to do animation in fabric.js__?
